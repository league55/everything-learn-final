These concepts are fundamental to object-oriented programming, promoting code reuse and efficiency.\n\n**Example:**\n```java\nclass Animal {\n  void sound() {\n    System.out.println(\"Animal sound\");\n  }\n}\n\nclass Dog extends Animal {\n  void sound() {\n    System.out.println(\"Woof\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis example shows a simple use of inheritance and polymorphism.",
